            <p>I'm Manjot Kaur Mand, I am a Software developer student. I used to play volleyball as a
                National Player and participated in a number cultural activities in my school in my home country. I love
                pets and I have a pet dog at home "Jack". The amazing thing is that each person who knows me from a long
                time calls me an allrounder.

                I was born in Punjab (Land of Five Rivers) , a famous province of an Asian country, India. Everyone at
                my
                home called me "Jot" and still they call me by this lovely name. I grew up in a Sikh family. My mother
                is a
                teacher and my father is a farmer. Overall,I love whatever I have in my life.

                My program, Software Developer, is a unique course. It's different from every other type of learning. I
                wanted to enrol in this program when I was in 8th grade. I didn't even know anything about the course.
                For instance, At starting it was like teaching trigonometry to a student of biology.However, when I
                think about doing something I just go for it. It's difficult to achieve higher goals but everything is
                possible with practice.
